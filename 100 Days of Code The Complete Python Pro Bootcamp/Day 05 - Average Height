Code Challenge: Average Height

Created on Tue Nov  5 18:01:16 2024

"""
You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height
from a list of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 149, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding the heights together and 
dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g. 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 149 + 146 = 1146

There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights.

1146 / 7 = 163.714285

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

# Don't change the code below
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
    student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])

# Don't change the code above


total_height = 0
total_students = 0

for height in student_heights:
    # print(student_heights[n])
    total_height += height
    total_students += 1

average_height = round(total_height / total_students)
