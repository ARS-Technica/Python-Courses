"""
Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal
year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.  The 
reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more 
justice: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE

This is how you work out whether a particular year is a leap year.

On every year that is evenly divisible by 4
except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
