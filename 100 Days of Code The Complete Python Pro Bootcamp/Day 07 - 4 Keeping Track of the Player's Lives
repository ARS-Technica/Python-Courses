"""
#TODO-1: - Create a variable called 'lives' to keep track of the number of lives left. 
#Set 'lives' to equal 6.

#TODO-2: - If guess is not a letter in the chosen_word, then reduce 'lives' by 1. 
If lives goes down to 0 then the game should stop and it should print "You lose."
    
#TODO-3: - print the ASCII art from 'stages' that corresponds to the current number of 'lives' the user has remaining.
