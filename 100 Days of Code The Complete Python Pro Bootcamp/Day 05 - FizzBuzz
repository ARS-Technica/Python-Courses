"""
You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the
FizzBuzz game.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz

Your program should should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should
print "Fizz".

When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it 
should print "Buzz".

And if the number is divisble by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the
number it should print "FizzBuzz"
