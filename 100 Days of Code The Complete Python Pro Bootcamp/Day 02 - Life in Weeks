"""
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks,
months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time 
left in this format:

    "You have x days, y weeks, and z months left."

# Don't change the code below
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# Don't change the code above


years = 90 - int(age)
days = years * 365
months = years * 12
weeks = years * 52


output = f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, or {months} months remaining until you're 90 years-old."
print(output)
