"""
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight
and height.  The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their 
height.  e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount,
the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of 
their height (in m):

BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (m^2)
